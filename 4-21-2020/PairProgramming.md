# Pair Programming

> 100% of me is nothing compared to 1% of the whole team

From the previous class, there have been some remarks stating that we could do more to interact with one another. Yes! That is the entire point of the club! If you wanted to program for interviews, competitive programming, etc you can easily do it by yourself. However, working together really expands yourself from your own mind, and you can see matters in other people's perspectives


### The Misconception of Programming

Programming while in movies seems to be an old, crusty dude typing on a computer, the modern approach towards programming is through communication and working together. The reason why big companies such as Microsoft, Google, Facebook have so many employees is not because there are so many products, but it is to work together for large projects.


### What is Pair Programming

Pair programming is synchronous coding where two of more programmers are looking at the same code at the same time. Rather than doing it individually, people look to other's screens, and one holds the power of typing the solution while the other instructs. Therefore, two people are able to work at it at the same time. Theoretically, this technique can really speed up programming, so we should practice for it.

However, if pair programming is so useful, why do we not do it at school?

This is inherently the problem with cse. Kevin has also has knocked out all the pair programming classes in the cse department (thanks berkeley), so I thought clubs can be able to emulate this process to bring to the real world.


### We will practice this today as a group

That means we are going to share code throughout the entire process

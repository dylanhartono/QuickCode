## BuyMaxCars
_Inspired from Round A KickStart 2020 Question Allocation_

I am looking through a catalog of cars at a dealership. They all have various different price points. I want to buy as many cars as I can at the dealership since I just won the lottery.

However, of course, I only have so much money, so I have a certain budget that I have...

How many cars can I buy?

## Parameters for the problem
```
int[] cars // catalog of cars where each value is the car's cost

int money // how much money I have to spend
```

## Examples
Input:   
`int[]{20, 90, 40, 90}, 100`

Output:   
`2`


### Some help?
```
Arrays.sort() // sorts arrays
```
